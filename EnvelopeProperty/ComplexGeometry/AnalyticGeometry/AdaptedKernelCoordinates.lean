# Coordinates adapted to finite-dimensional complex normed spaces

A finite-dimensional real normed space carrying a compatible complex vector
space structure is finite-dimensional over `ℂ`.  Consequently it admits a
continuous complex-linear equivalence with the standard complex model of its
complex dimension.  Pushing an additive Haar measure through this equivalence
gives an additive Haar measure in the coordinates, and the coordinate map is
measure-preserving for that pushed-forward measure.
