# Step 4 of regularization for the singular weight `e^{-mΨ}`

`QuantitativeRegularizationGermDomination.normSq_le_bergmanSup` is the germ-domination
half of the regularization lemma — the inequality `φ_m ≥ m⁻¹ ψ_{𝓘(mφ)} + O(1)` in the
weak form the Lean statement of `QuantitativeRegularization` asks for. Like everything
upstream it needs a *smooth* weight `ϕ` bounded below on `D`, whereas the weight that gets
substituted is `ϕ = m Ψ` with `Ψ` plurisubharmonic, hence `-∞` on a polar set.

This module removes that restriction. The passage is the same two-layer limit as in
`QuantitativeRegularizationSingularOverlap` — truncate, then mollify — but the shape of the
inequality is different, and so is the reason the constant survives:

* `le_mul_bergmanSup_multiplierWeight_of_smoothPsh` is the limit with a **constant** on the
  left. Only the `≥` half of the two limits is used, so the statement follows from the two
  *equalities* `bergmanSup(e^{-cu}) = ⨅ bergmanSup(e^{-c·truncation})` and
  `bergmanSup(e^{-c·truncation}) = ⨅ bergmanSup(e^{-c·mollification})` together with
  `le_mul_iInf`.
* Its `hcomp` hypothesis carries one clause the overlap version does not need: the smooth
  approximant **dominates** `u` on `A`. That clause is what keeps the weighted mass finite
  along the approximation, and it is available for free — mollifying the `k`-th truncation
  from above produces functions `≥ max(u, -k) ≥ u`.

The endpoint is `normSq_le_bergmanSup_multiplierWeight`: for `g` holomorphic near the
cut-off support whose weighted mass `N = ∫ |g|² e^{-mΨ}` over `tsupport θ` is finite — i.e.
for a germ of the multiplier ideal `𝓘(mΨ)` — and for every `y` near `x`,

> `|g y|² ≤ (C·N + 1) · bergmanSup B_j (e^{-mΨ}) y`, `C = pointExtensionConst d (r/2) Mθ (2S) S`.

The constant is the *same* `pointExtensionConst` as in the smooth theory: it involves the
dimension, the cut-off and the size of `B_j`, and nothing about the weight. `N` enters
only through the finiteness hypothesis, exactly as in the smooth case.

Why the mass stays finite along the approximation: the `j`-th mollification `f_j` of the
`k`-th truncation satisfies `f_j ≥ u` on `A`, so `e^{-m f_j} ≤ e^{-mu}` pointwise and the
approximate masses are all bounded by `N`. Since `pointExtensionConst` does not see the
weight, one constant `C·N + 1` serves every level of both layers, which is precisely the
hypothesis `le_mul_bergmanSup_multiplierWeight_of_smoothPsh` consumes.

/-! ### The two-layer limit with a constant on the left -/

variable {A Ω : Opens (ComplexModel d)} {u : ComplexModel d → EReal} {c : ℝ}

/-- **The two-layer singular-weight limit, constant-on-the-left form.**  A bound
`a ≤ C · bergmanSup D (e^{-cg})` valid for every smooth plurisubharmonic `g` that is
bounded below on `A` *and dominates `u` there* is a bound for the singular weight `e^{-cu}`.

Only the `≥` half of each of the two limits is needed, so this is a consequence of the two
equalities plus `le_mul_iInf`.  The domination clause `u ≤ g` is the one the germ-domination
consumer cannot do without: it is what bounds the approximate weighted masses by the
singular one. -/

/-! ### Germ domination for the singular weight -/

/-- **A germ of `𝓘(mΨ)` is dominated by the Bergman sup-weight of the singular weight**
(the regularization construction, the regularization, Step 4, for `ϕ = m Ψ`).

`Ψ` is an arbitrary plurisubharmonic function on `Ω` and may be `-∞` on a polar set; `A` is
a convex open set, relatively compact in `Ω`, containing the cut-off support and the closure
of `B_j`. The constant `pointExtensionConst d (r/2) Mθ (2S) S` is the one the smooth theory
produces and does not mention the weight; `N` enters only through its finiteness, which is
the statement that `g` is a germ of the multiplier ideal. -/
