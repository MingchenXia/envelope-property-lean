# The admissible logarithmic exponents of a plurisubharmonic germ are bounded

Source: Demailly, *Complex analytic and differential geometry*, III.5 (finiteness of the
Lelong number of a plurisubharmonic function which is not identically `-∞`).

Call `γ` *admissible* for `u` at `p` when `u ≤ γ log‖· - p‖ + C` on some punctured
neighbourhood of `p`.  The Lelong number of `u` at `p` is the supremum of the admissible
exponents (`Pluripotential.NonKahlerLocus.lelongNumber`), so it is finite exactly when the
admissible exponents are bounded above.

They are, and the bound is explicit: if `u` is plurisubharmonic on `ball p R` and `u y₀ ≠ ⊥`
for one point `y₀ ≠ p` of that ball, then every admissible `γ` satisfies

  `γ ≤ (A - u y₀) / (log R' - log ‖y₀ - p‖)`,

where `R'` is any radius with `‖y₀ - p‖ < R' < R` and `A` bounds `u` on `closedBall p R'`.
Both hypotheses are essential: without a finite value the function may be identically `⊥`,
for which every exponent is admissible, and in dimension `0` there is no such `y₀` at all.

The proof is Hadamard's three-circle inequality (`AnalyticGeometry.PshThreeCircles`) applied to the
triple of radii `exp t < ‖y₀ - p‖ < R'`: the admissible bound controls `u` on the inner
sphere, the compactness bound controls it on the outer sphere, and the finite value at `y₀`
forbids the interpolated bound from running off to `-∞` as `t → -∞`.  The only consequence of
the interpolation used is the single inequality obtained at `z = y₀`.

/-- **The admissible logarithmic exponents of a plurisubharmonic germ are bounded.**
The bound `s` is produced once and for all; it does not depend on the size of the punctured
neighbourhood on which an individual exponent happens to be admissible, which is exactly what
makes it a bound for the supremum. -/
