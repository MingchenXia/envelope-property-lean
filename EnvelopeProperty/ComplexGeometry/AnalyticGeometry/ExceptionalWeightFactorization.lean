# the IV H: the pulled-back ideal weight splits off the exceptional divisor

`RelativePrincipalization.exists_relativePrincipalization` produces, along with
the modification `f: Y' → Y` and the strict transform `W' = strictTransform f W`,
an effective divisor `H` supported in the exceptional locus with the **ideal**
identity

  `𝓘_W · 𝒪_{Y'} = 𝓘(H) · 𝓘_{W'}`.

the regularization construction uses it as an identity between *weights*,

  `ψ_{𝓘_W} ∘ f = ψ_H + ψ_{𝓘_{W'}} + O(1)` (the IV H),

with one constant on the compact `Y'`. That is exactly what this module records.
It is the composition of two results that already exist and are the two genuine
halves:

* `IdealWeightComparison.sameSingularityTypeOn_univ_comp_pullback` — the weight of
  a pulled-back ideal is the pullback of the weight, up to `O(1)`;
* `IdealWeightPowers.hasAnalyticSingularitiesOfType_mul` — the sum of two weights
  *presents* the product ideal (it produces a presentation rather than comparing a
  given one, which is what makes the substitution along the ideal identity legal).

Nothing here assumes `f` is proper, surjective, or a modification, and nothing
assumes anything about the supports: the statement is about the factorisation of
the ideal only. The complementary statement Step 4 also uses — that
`ψ_{𝓘_{W'}}` is bounded on compact subsets of `Y' \ W'` — is separate and lives in
`AnalyticGeometry/MeteredDivisorWeightBounds`.

/-- **IV H.**  If the pullback of `𝔞` factors as `𝔥 · 𝔟` and `φ`, `φ_𝔥`, `φ_𝔟`
present `𝔞`, `𝔥`, `𝔟` with one and the same positive rational coefficient, then

  `φ ∘ f = φ_𝔥 + φ_𝔟 + O(1)`

on a compact source, with a single constant.  The substitution along the ideal
identity is legal because `hasAnalyticSingularitiesOfType_mul` *produces* a
presentation of `𝔥 · 𝔟`, so no potential for the product has to be named. -/
