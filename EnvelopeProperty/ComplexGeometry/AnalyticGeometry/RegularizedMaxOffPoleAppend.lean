# The regularized maximum in the bounded smooth-off-pole convention: concatenate, do not align

`AnalyticGeometry.RegularizedMaxSmoothAnalyticType` needs the two branches of `M_δ(u,v)`
to be presented by the *same* generator family at a common pole, because the
STRONG convention asks the remainder to be smooth ACROSS the poles and
`M_δ(c·L + b₁, c·L + b₂) = c·L + M_δ(b₁,b₂)` only when the logarithm `L` is
literally shared. That alignment obligation is
`AnalyticGeometry.FiniteRegularizedMaxCoreCover.PolewiseAlignedBranches`, and nothing in
the tree produces it.

In the bounded smooth-off-pole convention, the remainder is BOUNDED near the point and
`C^∞` only off the pole set (`Pluripotential.BoundedSmoothOffPoleLogarithmicTypeAt`).
**In that convention alignment is not needed at all.** Two branches with the
same positive coefficient `c` and arbitrary families `f`, `g` combine under
`M_δ` with the concatenated family `Fin.append f g`:

* the remainder is bounded, because the ordinary maximum already has the
  concatenated presentation
  (`AnalyticGeometry.DemaillyAnalyticType.LogarithmicTypeAt.max_of_generators`) and `M_δ`
  differs from `max` by at most `δ`
  (`LogarithmicTypeAt.of_sandwich`);
* off the pole set of `Fin.append f g` at least one of the two branches is
  finite, so only the *second* and *third* cases of the three-case analysis of
  `hasSmoothAnalyticSingularitiesAt_eregularizedMax` occur — and those are
  exactly the cases whose proofs never mention a common family. Where both
  branches are finite `M_δ` is a smooth function of two smooth functions; where
  exactly one is a pole, the pole falls below the other branch by more than `δ`
  and `M_δ` equals the finite branch as a germ.

The device that makes the second bullet a *pointwise* statement at nearby points
rather than only at the centre is the **localization** of the presentation
predicates (`LogarithmicTypeAt.eventually` and its off-pole analogue): all three
clauses of the definition are witnessed on one honest open neighbourhood, so
every point of that neighbourhood inherits the presentation.

Combined with `canonicalRemainder` this yields the off-pole analogue of
`AnalyticGeometry.FiniteRegularizedMaxCoreCover.hasManifoldSmoothAnalyticSingularities_finiteRegularizedMaxGlued_of_coreCover`
with `PolewiseAlignedBranches` replaced by the hypothesis that all branches carry
ONE coefficient — which for a level-`m` Bergman atlas is `c = 1/m` and is
available.

/-! ### The append theorem -/

/-- **The regularized maximum of two branches in the bounded smooth-off-pole convention, with one
common coefficient, is again in that convention — presented by the CONCATENATED
generator family, with no alignment hypothesis whatsoever.**

Boundedness of the remainder comes from
`AnalyticGeometry.DemaillyAnalyticType.LogarithmicTypeAt.max_of_generators` (the ordinary
maximum already has the concatenated presentation) together with
`LogarithmicTypeAt.of_sandwich` (`max ≤ M_δ ≤ max + δ`). Smoothness off the
concatenated pole set is `exists_smooth_eventuallyEq_eregularizedMax`: a point
where the concatenated generators do not all vanish is a point where the two
branches do not have a common pole, so the alignment case never arises.

This is the statement that removes
`AnalyticGeometry.FiniteRegularizedMaxCoreCover.PolewiseAlignedBranches` from the route;
the price is the single common coefficient `c`, which for a level-`m` Bergman
atlas is `c = 1/m` and is available. -/
