# Reading a germ of `𝓘(mφ)` in a fixed chart, against the corrected weight

The local half of the regularization is proved in `ℂᵈ`
(`QuantitativeRegularizationGermGeneratorDomination`) for the **corrected** weight
`Ψ = φ ∘ e⁻¹ + ρ`, where `ρ` is a smooth local potential of `θ` in one fixed chart `e`:
`Ψ` is the honestly plurisubharmonic function, while `φ ∘ e⁻¹` alone is only quasi-psh.

The hypothesis the target supplies is membership in `𝓘(mφ)` at a point `y`, which by
definition (`Pluripotential.HolomorphicIdealSheaves.multiplierIdeal`) is tested in the
**preferred chart at `y`** and against the **raw** weight `φ ∘ (complexChartAt y)⁻¹`.

Two changes are therefore needed before the `ℂᵈ` statement applies at a point `y ≠ x` of
the fixed chart, and this module performs exactly those two:

* the chart, by `ChartWeightedL2.multiplierIntegrableAt_chart` (weighted integrability is
  a biholomorphic invariant; the only side condition is upper semicontinuity of the raw
  chart representative on the overlap, which holds because a θ-psh potential is
  quasi-psh in every chart);
* the weight, from `φ ∘ e⁻¹` to `Ψ = φ ∘ e⁻¹ + ρ`, by
  `multiplierIntegrableAt_of_moreSingularAt`: `ρ` is continuous, hence bounded below near
  the point, so the two weights have comparable singularity, and `Ψ` is plurisubharmonic
  there, which is the quasi-psh hypothesis that lemma asks of the target weight.

Nothing here is specific to Bergman kernels or to a generating system; it is the chart
bookkeeping that separates the model statement from the manifold statement.
