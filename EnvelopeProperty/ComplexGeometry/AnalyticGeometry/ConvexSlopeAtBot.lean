# The slope at `-∞` of a nondecreasing convex function

Source: Demailly, *Complex analytic and differential geometry*, I.4 (the Lelong number as the
slope at `-∞` of the ball supremum).

This file isolates the *real-analytic* half of the identification of a Lelong number with the
slope of `t ↦ sup_{‖z - p‖ ≤ e^t} u` at `t = -∞`.  Nothing here mentions plurisubharmonicity:
the input is a function `L : ℝ → ℝ` which, below a threshold `T`, is nondecreasing and satisfies
the chord inequality

`L b ≤ L a + (b - a) * (L c - L a) / (c - a)`  for `a < b < c < T`,

and the output is a nonnegative slope `s` together with the two asymptotic bounds that the
Lelong-number argument consumes:

* an *upper* bound `L t ≤ s * t + C` valid for all `t` below a threshold — this is the bound
  that makes `s` an admissible Lelong exponent;
* an *approximate lower* bound `(s + ε) * t + C' ≤ L t`, for each `ε > 0` and all `t` below an
  `ε`-dependent threshold — this is what prevents `L` from decaying faster than the slope, and
  it is the half that a supremum alone cannot see.

Together they say `L t / t → s` as `t → -∞`, but the two one-sided forms are what the
consumers use, and stating them separately avoids any `limsup` boundedness side conditions.

The slope `s` is nonnegative, it bounds `L` from above affinely near `-∞` (so it is an
admissible exponent), and no exponent larger than `s` bounds `L` from above near `-∞`, in the
sharp form of an affine *lower* bound with slope `s + ε`. -/
