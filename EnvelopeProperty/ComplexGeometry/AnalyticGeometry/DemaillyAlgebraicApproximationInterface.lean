# Demailly's approximation with algebraic singularities: the collar construction's form

The approximation used in CT22, Lemma 4.3, Step 3 is the chartwise
smooth-off-pole projection of
`AnalyticGeometry.Demailly1992AlgebraicApproximation.demailly1992_exists_algebraicApproximation`,
through `Demailly1992AlgebraicApproximation.exists_algebraicApproximation_smoothOffPole`.

It is Demailly's regularization
theorem (*Regularization of closed positive currents and intersection theory*,
J. Algebraic Geom. **1** (1992)), in the form Boucksom quotes it
(`bou02-volume:2.6`, blueprint node demailly algebraic approximation):

> Let `T` be a closed almost positive `(1,1)`-current on a compact complex `X`
> with a Hermitian form `ω`. Write `T = α + ddᶜφ` with `α` smooth and `φ` almost
> psh, and suppose given a continuous real form `γ` with `T ≥ γ`. Then there is
> a sequence `φ_k` of almost psh functions such that
> (i) `φ_k` has algebraic singularities;
> (ii) `φ_k` decreases to `φ` everywhere;
> (iii) the Lelong numbers `ν(φ_k,x)` converge to `ν(φ,x)` uniformly in `x`;
> (iv) setting `T_k = α + ddᶜφ_k`, one has `T_k ≥ γ - ε_kω` with `ε_k ↓ 0`.

## What is specialized, and why every specialization WEAKENS the statement

* `γ = 0`, i.e. the current is genuinely positive. That is the only case the
  collar construction uses (`ψ` is `(θ+ε₀ω)`-plurisubharmonic).
* Clause (i) is asked in the bounded smooth-off-pole convention
  (`HasManifoldAnalyticSingularitiesSmoothOffPole`: bounded remainder, `C^∞` off
  the poles, positive REAL coefficient) rather than "algebraic singularities"
  (rational coefficient, remainder smooth across the poles). The source's
  conclusion implies this one.
* Clause (ii) is `Antitone` together with `⨅ k, ψ_k x = ψ x`, which is exactly
  "decreases to `ψ` everywhere".
* Clause (iii) is OMITTED: the construction never uses Lelong numbers, and
  omitting a clause of an assumed input makes the assumption weaker.
* Clause (iv) is asked as `0 ≤ ε_k` with `ε_k → 0`, not as a decreasing
  sequence: only `∃ k, ε_k ≤ Λ/2` is ever used.

So the Lean statement below is implied by the source theorem clause by clause;
it is not a reformulation of its consumer. The consumer is the collar
construction, which adds the exhaustion, the cut-off, the downward shift and the
regularized-max gluing — none of which is in this statement.

/-- **Demailly 1992, in Boucksom's form `bou02-volume:2.6`, with `γ = 0` and
clause (i) in the bounded smooth-off-pole sense.**  A positive current `α + ddᶜψ` on a
compact Kähler manifold is approximated from above by currents with analytic
singularities, at an asymptotically vanishing loss of positivity.
