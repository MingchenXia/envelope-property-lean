# The Bergman kernel of `e^{-cu}` from the kernels of the truncations `max (u, -k)`

`QuantitativeRegularizationSingularWeight.bergmanSup_iSup_weight` is the abstract limit:
for weights increasing on `D` and locally bounded below there, the kernel of their
supremum is the infimum of the kernels. This module runs it on the approximating
sequence used in the construction, the plurisubharmonic truncations
`truncationReal u k = (max (u, -k)).toReal` of `Pluripotential.MongeAmpere`:

  `bergmanSup D (e^{-cu}) y = ⨅ k, bergmanSup D (e^{-c·max (u,-k)}) y`.

Each hypothesis of the abstract theorem is discharged from plurisubharmonicity of `u`
alone:

* monotone — `truncationReal` is antitone in `k` and `multiplierWeight c` is antitone
  (`multiplierWeight_antitone`);
* supremum — `OhsawaTakegoshiRegularReduction.multiplierWeight_le_iSup_truncationReal`
  gives `≥`, and truncation only raises the potential, which gives `≤`;
* a.e.-measurable — the truncations are plurisubharmonic, hence upper semicontinuous,
  hence a.e.-measurable on an open set
  (`ChartWeightedL2.aemeasurable_restrict_of_upperSemicontinuousOn`);
* locally bounded below — `truncationReal_isLocallyBoundedPshOn`: the truncation is
  locally bounded *above*, so `e^{-c·truncation}` is locally bounded *below* by a
  positive constant.

`bergmanSup_multiplierWeight_le_mul_of_truncation` is the consequence: a comparison of
two Bergman kernels with one constant, valid for every truncation, is a comparison for
the singular weight itself. This is the shape in which the reg overlap is
consumed, `C_B` being fixed by the cover before the weight
(`BergmanOverlapFixedCover.exists_overlapConst_finite`).

The remaining half of frontier item 1 is the *smoothness* of the approximating weight:
the truncations are plurisubharmonic and locally bounded but not smooth, so one further
layer, `HolomorphicPullback.exists_decreasingMollifierApproximation` on a relatively
compact subdomain, is needed before the overlap estimate itself applies. That layer is
another instance of the same abstract theorem, and is not done here.
