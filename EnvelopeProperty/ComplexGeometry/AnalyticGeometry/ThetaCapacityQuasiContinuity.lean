# Quasi-continuity for the global capacity

Xia's Theorem 2.3.2 says that a `theta`-PSH potential is quasi-continuous for
the capacity `Cap_theta`.  Bedford--Taylor quasi-continuity in a chart is
already available, sorry-free, in
`AnalyticGeometry.BedfordTaylorQuasiContinuity`; `AnalyticGeometry.ThetaCapacityChart` compares
`Cap_theta` with the chart capacity.  This module composes the two and
produces the **local** form: around every point of the manifold there is a
neighbourhood `N` and an open set `G` of arbitrarily small `Cap_theta` such
that the potential is continuous on `N \ G`.

The reference `V` and the potential `w` are both assumed globally bounded, and
for the reference this is a real restriction: `V_theta` itself is unbounded
below whenever `nK({theta}) != emptyset`, so what is proved is Xia's Theorem
2.3.2 *relative to a globally bounded reference*, not for `Cap_theta` proper.
See the corresponding discussion in `AnalyticGeometry.ThetaCapacityChart`; lifting the
restriction means restating the stack relative to an open set relatively
compact in `X \ nK({theta})`, which is a different architecture from the
global statements here.

The pointwise statement is then globalized.  The neighbourhood produced
around a point depends only on the chart and its smooth local potential, not
on the tolerance, so a finite subcover of the compact manifold may be
extracted first and the tolerance divided among its members afterwards;
finite subadditivity of `Cap_theta` bounds the union, and continuity off it is
glued from the members, each neighbourhood being open.  The result,
`exists_isOpen_thetaCapacity_lt_continuousOn_compl`, is Xia's Theorem 2.3.2
for a globally bounded potential and a globally bounded reference.
