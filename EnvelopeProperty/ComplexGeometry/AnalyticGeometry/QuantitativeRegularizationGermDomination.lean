# A germ of the weighted space is dominated by the Bergman sup-weight

Step 4 of the regularization construction needs the lower bound `φ_{j,m} ≥ m⁻¹ ψ_{𝓘(mφ)} + O(1)` near a point. the regularization construction
gets it from `\cite[Proposition 1.2]{DEL00}`: the multiplier ideal is *generated* on `B_j` by
the orthonormal basis of `H_{j,m}`. The Lean statement of the regularization lemma is weaker —
it only asks that every finite family of germs of `𝓘(mφ)` at a point be dominated — and that
weaker form follows from the *same* point extension as Step 2, applied at each point of a small
ball instead of once at the centre.

`normSq_le_bergmanSup` is that statement: if `g` is holomorphic on a neighbourhood `U` of the
cut-off support and its weighted `L²` norm `N` over `tsupport θ` is finite, then at every `y`
close to `x`

  `|g y|² ≤ (C · N + 1) · bergmanSup B_j e^{-ϕ} y`,

with `C = pointExtensionConst d (r/2) Mθ (2S) S` depending only on the cut-off and the size of
`B_j`. Dividing by `m` and taking logarithms (`ϕ = m Ψ`) this is
`m⁻¹ log|g|² ≤ Ψ_{j,m} + O(1)` for the common-weight kernel `Ψ_{j,m}` of
`AnalyticGeometry.QuantitativeRegularizationBergmanOverlap`; the passage to own-weight
`ψ_{j,m}` needs the same holomorphic-multiplier isometry recorded there.

The trick is that the extension point may vary: `θ ≡ 1` on `ball x r` also gives `θ ≡ 1` on
`ball y (r/2)` for every `y ∈ ball x (r/2)`, so one fixed cut-off serves every `y`, and the
constant does not move with `y`.

As in the rest of Step 2 the weight `ϕ` here is smooth and bounded below; see
`AnalyticGeometry.QuantitativeRegularizationPointExtension` for those restrictions and why the lower
bound is the one that really costs something.
