# The local half of regularization, stated on the manifold

`QuantitativeRegularizationMultiplierGermFamily` proves Step 4 in the model `ℂᵈ` from the
germ hypothesis `MultiplierIntegrableAt u m gᵢ z volume`. The statement of
`QuantitativeRegularization` is about a manifold `Z` and asks for germs of the sheaf
`multiplierIdeal m φ`.

No coordinate transfer is needed for the *hypothesis*: `multiplierIdeal m φ` is defined at
`x` through the **preferred chart at `x`**, so
`(multiplierIdeal m φ).mem x g` is literally `HolomorphicAt d g x` together with
`MultiplierIntegrableAt (chartFunction φ (complexChartAt x)) m (g ∘ (complexChartAt x).symm)`
at `(complexChartAt x) x`. What has to be transported is the *conclusion*, and only
across the chart source, where `e.symm ∘ e = id`; that is what
`generatorLog_comp_symm_eventuallyEq` records.

The consequence worth stating plainly: the local lower bound
`φ_m ≥ m⁻¹ log ∑ᵢ|gᵢ|² + O(1)` holds for **every** finite family of germs of `𝓘(mφ)` at
`x`, not only for a generating system. The Lean statement of the target quantifies
exactly over finite families, so this route needs no Nadel coherence anywhere. What is
still missing between here and the target is the *global* object: one `φ_m` on all of `Z`,
glued from the chart branches with a single curvature loss `c/m`.

/-- **Step 4 of regularization on the manifold, for an arbitrary germ family.**

For every finite family `g` of germs of `𝓘(mφ)` at `x` there is one real constant `C`
with

> `m⁻¹ log ∑ᵢ |gᵢ(y)|² - C ≤ m⁻¹ log K_{B_j}(e(y), e^{-mφ∘e⁻¹})`

for all `y` near `x`, where `e` is the preferred chart at `x` and `B_j` is any Bergman
domain containing `e(x)` and relatively compact in the convex `A ⋐ Ω`.

No generating system of `𝓘(mφ)` appears, so nothing here needs coherence. -/
