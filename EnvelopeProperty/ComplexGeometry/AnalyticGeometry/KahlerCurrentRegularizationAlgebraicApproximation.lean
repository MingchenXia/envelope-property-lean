# Kähler currents with analytic singularities from Demailly's approximation theorem

Source: Demailly, *Regularization of closed positive currents and intersection
theory*, J. Algebraic Geom. **1** (1992), Theorem 1.1, in the form Boucksom
quotes it (Boucksom, *On the volume of a line bundle*, Theorem 2.6); the deduction is the one in the proof of
Boucksom, *Divisorial Zariski decompositions*, Theorem 3.17.

## Overview

This module derives

  `KahlerCurrentRegularization.exists_kahlerCurrent_poleSet_subset_lelongNumber_pos`

from Demailly's approximation theorem, *exactly as Boucksom does*, so that
Demailly 1992 enters as one named input.

## Boucksom's deduction, and what it costs

Let `T = θ + ddᶜφ ≥ ω'` be a Kähler current in `α`.  Apply the approximation
theorem to the **positive** current `T - ω' = (θ - ω') + ddᶜφ`, i.e. with
`γ = 0` and the smooth form `θ - ω'`.  It returns `φ_k ↓ φ` with analytic
singularities and

  `(θ - ω') + δ_k ω' + ddᶜφ_k ≥ 0`,   `δ_k ↓ 0`.

For `δ_k < 1` this reads `θ + ddᶜφ_k ≥ (1 - δ_k) ω'`, so `θ + ddᶜφ_k` is again a
Kähler current in the **same** class `α` — the representative is untouched, only
the Kähler lower bound shrinks.  A pole of `φ_k` has positive Lelong number
because `φ_k` has analytic singularities
(`AnalyticSingularityPoleLelong`), and `ν(φ_k, x) ≤ ν(φ, x)` because
`φ_k ≥ φ` (`KahlerCurrentMax.lelongNumber_le_of_eventually_le`).  Hence the
pole set of `φ_k` lies in the positive-Lelong locus of `φ`, which is the
conclusion.

Note that only `δ_k → 0` is used, and only through "some index has `δ_k < 1`";
clause (iii) of the published theorem (uniform convergence of Lelong numbers) is
**not** needed — the comparison `ν(φ_k) ≤ ν(φ)` comes from `φ_k ≥ φ` alone, and
that is clause (ii).

## The global form of clause (i)

`AnalyticGeometry.DemaillyAlgebraicApproximation.exists_algebraicApproximation` states
clause (i) only in the chartwise smooth-off-pole convention
(`HasManifoldAnalyticSingularitiesSmoothOffPole`), which is all that the
collar construction of CT22 4.3 needs.  The theorem here needs more: both
its `HasAnalyticSingularities` conclusion and the positive-Lelong step go
through the **global** form of analytic singularities (a positive rational
coefficient and a coherent ideal).  That is what Demailly's clause (i) actually
says — "algebraic singularities" — so it is stated here as in the published
theorem, and nothing else is added:
`γ = 0`, clause (iii) omitted, clause (iv) as `0 ≤ δ_k → 0`.

The interface below is therefore the published theorem with clause (i) in both
forms.  Consequently `exists_algebraicApproximation`'s own statement is a
**corollary** of it, proved here as `exists_algebraicApproximation_of_stronger`:
the two are not two independent assumptions.

**The base statement.**  The strong statement is stated once, in
`AnalyticGeometry.Demailly1992AlgebraicApproximation`
(`demailly1992_exists_algebraicApproximation`), which imports `Pluripotential` only;
`demailly1992_exists_algebraicApproximation_analyticSingularities` below has the
same statement and is proved as its projection, so this module adds no assumption
of its own.  The smooth-off-pole form is the projection
`Demailly1992AlgebraicApproximation.exists_algebraicApproximation_smoothOffPole` of the same base declaration.

## Not a restatement of its application

The interface quantifies over an arbitrary closed real `(1,1)`-form, an
arbitrary `θ`-psh potential and an arbitrary Kähler background; it mentions no
Kähler current, no class, no Lelong number and no pole set.  The deduction below
adds the shift by `ω'`, the choice of index, the reconstruction of a Kähler
current in the same class, and the two Lelong steps.

/-- **Demailly 1992 Theorem 1.1, in Boucksom's form (*On the volume of a line bundle*, Theorem 2.6), with
`γ = 0` and clause (i) in both conventions** — a projection of the
single named form,
`Demailly1992AlgebraicApproximation.demailly1992_exists_algebraicApproximation`.

Identical to `DemaillyAlgebraicApproximation.exists_algebraicApproximation`
except that clause (i) is also asked in the *global* form of analytic
singularities — a positive rational coefficient along a coherent ideal with a
bounded remainder — which is what "algebraic singularities" means in the
published statement.  Clause (iii) is still omitted and `γ` is still `0`, so
every deviation from the source still weakens it. -/

in a class on a compact complex manifold is dominated by a Kähler current in the
*same* class with analytic singularities whose pole set lies in the
positive-Lelong locus of the original potential.

The class is unchanged because the representative is unchanged: only the Kähler
lower bound shrinks from `ω'` to `(1 - δ_k) ω'`. -/
