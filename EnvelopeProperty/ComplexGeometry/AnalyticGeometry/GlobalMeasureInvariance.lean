# Global measure invariance under smooth changes of representative

For `η = θ + ddᶜf`, replacing `u` by `u-f` leaves every corrected local
potential unchanged. The actual coordinate measures and matched finite-cover
constructions therefore agree. Cover independence identifies the canonical
global measures. No new analytic hole, mass bound, or nondegeneracy assumption
is needed. These compositions use the proved local product theory and overlap
compatibility; they inherit no unfinished hole.

This is a change of the pair (background form, potential). Same singularity
type with a fixed background only implies equality of total masses, and is
not asserted to identify measures here.
