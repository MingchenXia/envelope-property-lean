# Locally uniform upper bounds

The local condition in this file is relative to the domain: at a point of
`Ω`, one asks for a member of `𝓝[Ω] x` and one real constant which bounds every
member of the family on the intersection of that neighbourhood with `Ω`.

The main result is the finite-subcover passage from this local condition to a
single real upper bound on an arbitrary compact subset of `Ω`.  No regularity
of the individual functions is needed.
