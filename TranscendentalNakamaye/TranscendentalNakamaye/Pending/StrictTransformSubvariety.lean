# The strict transform of a subvariety under one blowup

Source: CT22, Section 4; Griffiths--Harris, Ch. 1 §4; blueprint
`ana:strict-transform-subvariety`.

Let `g : Z → Y` be the blowup of a compact complex manifold along a smooth centre, `T` the
image of its exceptional locus, and `W ⊆ Y` a closed irreducible analytic subvariety with
`W ⊄ T`.  Then the strict transform `W̃ = closure (g⁻¹ W \ Exc g)` is a closed irreducible
analytic subvariety with `dim W̃ = dim W`.

* Analyticity: `Exc g = g⁻¹ T` (`ExceptionalFibres`), so `W̃ = closure (g⁻¹ W \ g⁻¹ T)`
  is the closure of a difference of analytic sets.
* Dimension: pick a regular point `c ∉ T` of `W` of dimension `dim W`; its unique preimage
  `c̃` is not exceptional, `W̃` agrees with `g⁻¹ W` off `Exc g`, and regularity transports
  across the local biholomorphism.
* Irreducibility: `W` is the closure of the connected component `K` of its regular locus
  through `c` (`eq_closure_component`); `K \ T` is connected and dense in `K`
  (`ComponentComplementConnected`); since `g` restricted to `Z \ Exc g` is an injective
  open map, `g⁻¹ (K \ T)` is a connected set of regular points of `W̃`, hence lies in the
  component `K̃` through `c̃`, and it is dense in `W̃`.  So `W̃ = closure K̃` is irreducible.
