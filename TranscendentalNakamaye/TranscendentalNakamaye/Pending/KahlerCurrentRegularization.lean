# Demailly regularization of Kähler currents

Source: Demailly, *Regularization of closed positive currents and intersection
theory* (1992), Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 3.7; Boucksom, *Divisorial Zariski
decompositions*, Theorem 2.4 and the proof of Theorem 3.17; CT22, Section 2
("By Demailly's regularization, big classes contain Kähler currents with
analytic singularities"); blueprint `ana:locus-properties`.

Let `T = θ + ddᶜφ ≥ ω₀` be a Kähler current on a compact Kähler manifold.
Demailly's Bergman-kernel regularization produces quasi-psh functions
`φ_m = (1/2m) log ∑ |σ_{m,j}|² + O(1)` with `θ + ddᶜφ_m ≥ ω₀ - ε_m ω`,
`ε_m → 0`, analytic singularities along the multiplier ideal `𝓘(mφ)`, and
`ν(φ, x) - n/m ≤ ν(φ_m, x) ≤ ν(φ, x)`.  For `m` large `θ + ddᶜφ_m` is again a
Kähler current, and a point where `φ_m = -∞` has `ν(φ_m, x) > 0`, hence
`ν(φ, x) > 0`.

The singularities are asserted in the two compatible `I-0489` forms the
consumers use: a rational coefficient with a bounded remainder along a
coherent ideal (`HasAnalyticSingularities`) and the separately proved fact that
the potential is smooth off its polar set
(`HasManifoldAnalyticSingularitiesSmoothOffPole`).  The latter is sufficient
for the admissible restricted-current presentations, whose definition uses the
same smooth-off-pole convention.  No claim is made that a bounded logarithmic
remainder extends smoothly across the poles.

**What is missing, and where.**  Since the human's decision of 30 Sep
(`I-0598`, answering `I-0565`) the route is Boucksom's: the theorem below is
derived from Demailly's approximation theorem as ONE named classical input,
`KahlerCurrentRegularizationAlgebraicApproximation.demailly1992_exists_algebraicApproximation_analyticSingularities`
(`bou02-volume:2.6`, `γ = 0`, clause (i) in both conventions).  The deduction —
the shift by the Kähler lower bound, the choice of an index with `δ_k < 1`, the
reconstruction of a Kähler current in the same class, and the two Lelong steps —
is proved there.

The previous route went through the ordered regularized-max Bergman record of
`Pending.DemaillyRegularizedMaxBergmanDataInterface` (Bergman kernels of
weighted `L²` spaces on coordinate balls, Ohsawa--Takegoshi at the needed
generality, Nadel coherence, Skoda-type Lelong comparison, and the global
gluing).  Per `I-0459` those modules stay in the tree, and this module still
imports `KahlerCurrentRegularizationInterface` so that they stay reachable; but
they are **superseded** and no longer appear in this theorem's *proof-term*
cone, which is what `#print axioms` measures.  `exists_kahlerCurrent_poleSet_eq_nonKahlerLocus` continues to
be PROVED from the theorem below together with `Pending.AnalyticNoetherProperty`
and the sorry-free `Pending.KahlerCurrentMax`.

/-- **Source-interface wrapper** (Demailly regularization, Kähler-current form).
Every Kähler current in a class on a compact complex manifold is dominated by a
Kähler current in the same class with analytic singularities whose polar set lies
in the set where the original current has positive Lelong number.  The
regularized potential is smooth away from that polar set. -/
