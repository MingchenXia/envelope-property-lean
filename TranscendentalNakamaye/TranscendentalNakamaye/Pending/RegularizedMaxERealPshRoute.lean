# The PSH closure interface for an extended-real regularized maximum

`RegularizedMaxEReal.eregularizedMax` is an honest pointwise operation on
extended reals: it keeps exactly the common poles of its two inputs.  Its
pointwise algebra, however, cannot prove plurisubharmonicity through those
poles.  In particular, the real `C²` Hessian calculation applies only where
both branches are finite; it does not by itself give upper semicontinuity or
the disc submean inequality at a common pole.

This module isolates that analytic gap precisely.  `ThetaPshAcross θ w Z` is
not an assertion that `w` is globally theta-PSH: it asks only for the chart
PSH germs based at points of `Z`.  Together with the already-local
`ThetaPlurisubharmonicOn` criterion off `Z`, the assembly theorem proves the
global raw theta-PSH statement.  Applied to `eregularizedMax`, its natural
exceptional set is the common-pole set, proved here directly from the
pointwise definition.

Thus a later removable-singularity/upper-semicontinuous closure theorem has a
small, explicit target: construct `ThetaPshAcross` for this common-pole set.
No such analytic closure result is claimed in this file.
