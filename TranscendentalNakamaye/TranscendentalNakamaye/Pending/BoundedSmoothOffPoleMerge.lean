# Merging two `I-0489` presentations of the *same* function

`Pending.RegularizedMaxOffPoleAppend` concatenates the generator families of two
*different* branches under the regularized maximum.  The Demailly frame data
needs the other combination: at one point of a manifold several overlapping
Bergman charts present the *same* potential, and the presentation carried to the
next chart must be the concatenation of all of them.

The mechanism is a general upgrade lemma.  A bounded-remainder presentation
(`FirstPass.LogarithmicTypeAt`) of a function which *is* of `I-0489` type
automatically has the off-pole smoothness clause:

* off the pole set of the family the presented function is finite, hence a
  smooth real germ there by
  `FirstPass.AdmissibleCurrentFormPositivity.exists_smooth_eventuallyEq_of_hasAnalyticSingularitiesSmoothOffPoleAt`;
* the logarithm of the family's norm square is smooth wherever it is positive;
* so the remainder, which is their difference as a germ, is smooth there.

Hence merging reduces to the bounded-remainder statement already proved for the
ordinary maximum (`Pending.DemaillyAnalyticType.LogarithmicTypeAt.max_of_generators`)
applied with `max u u = u`.  No alignment of the two families and no relation
between their pole sets is needed.

/-- **A bounded-remainder presentation of a function of `I-0489` type is itself an
`I-0489` presentation.**

The hypothesis is only that the presented function has *some* `I-0489`
presentation at every nearby point — not that it has one with this coefficient or
this family.  Off the pole set of `f` the function is finite, so it is a smooth
real germ there, and the remainder is that germ minus the smooth real logarithm
of `generatorNormSq f`. -/

This is the companion of
`Pending.RegularizedMaxOffPoleAppend.boundedSmoothOffPoleLogarithmicTypeAt_eregularizedMax_append`,
which concatenates the families of two branches of a regularized maximum.  Here
nothing is combined on the function side: `max u u = u`, so the bounded-remainder
concatenation theorem for the ordinary maximum already gives the presentation,
and the upgrade lemma supplies the off-pole clause. -/
