# Connectedness of a blowup

Source: Griffiths--Harris, Ch. 1 §4 (the blowup of a manifold along a smooth centre and its
fibres); Voisin I, §3.3.  Used by CT22, Lemma 4.4 / Copy-4 `lem:resolution`, where the
modification `μ : X̃ → X` is required to be a *connected* compact Kähler manifold.

The classical proof describes the fibres of `π` (points off `C`, projectivised normal spaces
over `C`) and applies the fact that a closed surjection with connected fibres over a connected
base has connected total space.  The workspace characterises the blowup by its universal
property only (`FirstPass.BlowupSequences.IsBlowupAlong`) and has no description of the
exceptional fibres, so the argument used here avoids them entirely:

* `C` is a proper closed analytic subset of `M`, so `M \ C` is connected
  (`Pending.AnalyticComplementConnected.isPreconnected_compl`; a connected complex manifold is
  irreducible and an analytic set has real codimension at least two);
* the holomorphic section of `Pending.BlowupIsomorphismOff.exists_section_compl` has range
  exactly `π⁻¹(M \ C)`, which is therefore connected;
* `π⁻¹ C` has empty interior (`Pending.ExceptionalFibres.interior_preimage_eq_empty`), so
  `π⁻¹(M \ C)` is dense and its closure `Z` is connected.

Everything in this file is proved.

/-- **The blowup of a connected complex manifold along a nowhere dense closed submanifold is
connected.**

Proof.  `C` is a proper closed analytic subset, so `M \ C` is connected
(`AnalyticComplementConnected.isPreconnected_compl`).  The holomorphic section
`s : M \ C → Z` of `Pending.BlowupIsomorphismOff.exists_section_compl` has range exactly
`π⁻¹(M \ C)`, so that preimage is the continuous image of a connected set, hence connected;
and it is dense in `Z` because `π⁻¹ C` has empty interior
(`Pending.ExceptionalFibres.interior_preimage_eq_empty`).  A dense connected subset has
connected closure, which is all of `Z`.  No description of the exceptional fibres is needed. -/
