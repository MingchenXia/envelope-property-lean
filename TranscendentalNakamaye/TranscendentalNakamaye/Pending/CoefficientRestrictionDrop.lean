# The restricted coefficient ideal with the members containing `S` deleted

Blueprint `hir:coefficient-restriction` (`blueprint/src/hironaka.tex`, Hironaka phase H4, Step 1a of Proposition
`hir:maximal-order-step`).  Source: Włodarczyk 2005, Lemmas `le:cf`, `le:S`, `le:S2` and Step 1a (the marked ideal
`(S, 𝓒(𝓙)|_S, E_S, μ_𝓒)` with `E_S` the members of `E` not containing `S`).

TN23 proved Włodarczyk's `le:S` in full keeping the divisor `E` (`CoefficientRestrictionTower.coeff_restrict_tower_iff`).
Step 1a needs the divisor `E_S` (the members containing `S` deleted); deleting them changes nothing along towers with
centres in the strict transforms of `S` (`DropMembers`).  Combining the two:

* `coeff_restrict_withE_iff`: for `𝔪 = (X, X, E, 𝔞, μ)` well formed, `𝔞` coherent, `μ ≥ 1`, a closed submanifold `S`, and
  `E'` a list of members of `E` such that every member of `E` missing from `E'` contains `S`: a tower is a multiple test
  blow-up of `(X, S, E', 𝓒(𝔞), μ_𝓒)` iff it is one of `𝔪` with centres in the strict transforms of `S`, and along it
  `cosupp = cosupp 𝔪_T ∩ S_T`.

Import discipline (Hironaka phase): this module does not import, even transitively,
`Pending.RelativePrincipalization` or `Pending.EmbeddedResolution`.  Sorry-free.
