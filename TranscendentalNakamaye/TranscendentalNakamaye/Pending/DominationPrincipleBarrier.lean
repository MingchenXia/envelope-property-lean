# The Perron barrier family of Xia's domination principle

In the ordered case `phi ≤ psi` of Xia's Theorem 2.4.5 the barriers are the
Perron envelopes

  `eta a := P_theta (a * phi + (1 - a) * psi)`,  `a > 1`,

which in this workspace is `rooftopEnvelope theta (convexComb a phi psi)`
(`xia-sgpt:page-0088`; `convexComb a` is Xia's obstacle exactly, with the
weight `a > 1` outside `[0,1]`).  Two of the four properties the closing stage
`Pending.DominationPrincipleReduction.le_of_null_barrier_family` asks of the
family are unconditional facts about that envelope and are proved here:

* the family is **antitone in `a`** (the obstacle is, because `phi ≤ psi` and
  increasing `a` moves the obstacle towards `phi` with a negative weight on
  `psi`);
* every member **lies below `phi`**, since the obstacle at `a = 1` is `phi`
  itself and the rooftop envelope of a genuine potential is that potential.

The remaining two — that each member is a genuine `theta`-PSH potential of the
reference mass (Xia's Lemma 2.4.4 and Corollary 2.4.3), and that each meets
`phi` off a `theta^n_phi`-null set (the measure chain built from Theorem 2.4.4
and Lemma 2.4.2) — are the analytic middle stage and are not addressed here.
