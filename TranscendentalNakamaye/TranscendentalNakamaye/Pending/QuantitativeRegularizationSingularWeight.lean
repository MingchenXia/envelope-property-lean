# The Bergman kernel of a singular weight as a decreasing limit of regular ones

Source: Copy-4, `lem:regularization`, Step 2 (`transcendental-nakamaye-copy4-20260911`);
blueprint `ana:regularization`.  Demailly, *Analytic methods in algebraic geometry*,
Theorem 13.2 and its proof.

Every quantitative statement about `bergmanSup` that the regularization chain
currently has — `QuantitativeRegularizationBergmanOverlap.bergmanSup_le_of_pointExtension`
and everything built on it, up to `BergmanOverlapFixedCover.exists_overlapConst_finite` —
assumes the weight `e^{-ϕ}` has `ϕ` **smooth** and **bounded below**.  Copy-4 applies
those statements to `ϕ = m Ψ` with `Ψ` merely plurisubharmonic, hence `-∞` on a polar
set.  This is the most blocking gap of the whole chain, and no
bookkeeping closes it: replacing `Ψ` by `max (Ψ, -k)` makes the weight
`e^{-ϕ}` **smaller**, hence the weighted unit ball **larger** and `bergmanSup`
**larger**, so the comparison has to be closed by a limit from above, not by monotone
convergence.

This module supplies that limit.

* `bergmanBall_subset_of_weight_le` / `bergmanSup_antitone_weight` — the elementary
  half: a larger weight has a smaller unit ball, hence a smaller kernel.  This is the
  direction that makes the truncated kernels *decrease*.
* `bergmanSup_congr_of_eqOn` — only the values of a weight on `D` matter.
* `bergmanSup_iSup_weight` — **the limit itself**: for a sequence of weights increasing
  on `D` and locally bounded below there by a positive constant, the kernel of any
  weight whose restriction to `D` is their pointwise supremum is the *infimum* of the
  kernels, `bergmanSup D w∞ y = ⨅ i, bergmanSup D (w i) y`.
  The nontrivial inequality is `≥`: a family of competitors, one in each truncated
  unit ball, is locally uniformly bounded (the weights are bounded below), so Montel
  extracts a locally uniform limit, Fatou plus monotone convergence keep it inside the
  unit ball of the supremum weight (`WeightedL2ExtensionLimit`), and locally uniform
  convergence transports the point value.
* `bergmanSup_le_mul_of_iSup_weight` — the consequence the overlap estimate needs: a
  comparison `bergmanSup D₁ (w i) y ≤ C · bergmanSup D₂ (w i) y` that holds for every
  member of the approximating sequence, with a constant `C` independent of `i`, passes
  to the singular weight.  This is the exact shape of Copy-4's `eq:reg-overlap`, whose
  constant is already known to be weight-independent
  (`BergmanOverlapFixedCover.exists_overlapConst_finite`).

Nothing here assumes plurisubharmonicity, smoothness, or any relation between `D₁` and
`D₂`: the statements are about weighted Bergman kernels alone, so they apply verbatim to
the smooth truncations `ϕ_k = m · max (Ψ, -k)` and, after
`HolomorphicPullback.exists_decreasingMollifierApproximation`, to their smooth
regularizations.

`D` alone.  All hypotheses below are therefore stated on `D`. -/

/-- **The Bergman kernel of a singular weight is the decreasing limit of the regular
ones.**  For an increasing sequence of weights, locally bounded below by a positive
constant, the kernel of the pointwise supremum is the infimum of the kernels.

Applied to `w i = e^{-m·max (Ψ, -i)}` — or to any smooth decreasing regularization of
those truncations — this is the statement that closes that gap: a bound for the
kernels of the regular weights, uniform in `i`, is a bound for the kernel of `e^{-mΨ}`. -/

/-- **A weight-uniform comparison passes to the singular weight.**  If the two Bergman
kernels of an increasing family of weights are comparable with ONE constant `C`, then so
are the kernels of the supremum weight.  Only the right-hand domain needs the hypotheses
of the limit theorem.

This is exactly how Copy-4's `eq:reg-overlap` is used: `C_B` is fixed by the cover before
the weight (`BergmanOverlapFixedCover.exists_overlapConst_finite`), so the comparison is
available for every member of an approximating sequence with the same `C`. -/
