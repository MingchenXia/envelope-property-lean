# `eq:reg-overlap` for the singular weight `e^{-mΨ}`

Source: Copy-4, `lem:regularization`, Step 2 (`transcendental-nakamaye-copy4-20260911`);
blueprint `ana:regularization`.

`BergmanOverlapFixedCover.exists_overlapConst_finite` closes two gaps of the regularization
chain: for a *finite* family of
coordinate balls inside a convex bounded `D` there is ONE constant `C_B`, fixed by the
family alone, comparing the two Bergman sup-weights at every point of the intersection of
the inner half-balls, in **both** directions and for **every** smooth psh weight `ϕ`
bounded below on `D`.  Its scope note records what was still missing: Copy-4 applies the
estimate to `ϕ = m Ψ` with `Ψ` merely plurisubharmonic, hence `-∞` on a polar set, and
none of the upstream Bergman machinery admits such a weight.

`QuantitativeRegularizationSmoothWeightLimit.bergmanSup_multiplierWeight_le_mul_of_smoothPsh`
is precisely the converter for that gap, and its hypothesis is precisely what
`exists_overlapConst_finite` delivers.  This module performs the composition, and that
closes this gap for the overlap estimate:

> `exists_overlapConst_finite_multiplierWeight`: one constant `C`, fixed by the finite
> ball family alone, with
> `bergmanSup (B i) (e^{-mΨ}) ≤ C · bergmanSup (B j) (e^{-mΨ})`
> for **every** plurisubharmonic `Ψ` on a neighbourhood of `A`, every `m > 0`, and every
> pair of indices — `Ψ` and `m` both chosen after `C`.

Two remarks on the hypotheses.

* The `ϕ`-boundedness hypothesis `hBϕ` of the smooth theory is **not** removed and does
  not need to be: the mollifier layer supplies smooth approximants that are bounded below on `A`
  by construction, so `hBϕ` is discharged rather than dropped.  The singular weight itself is
  unbounded below and never has to satisfy it.
* `m` is a real parameter, quantified after `C`, so the logarithmic form below divides
  by `m` to give Copy-4's `|ψ_{i,m} - ψ_{j,m}| ≤ C_B / m` with the same `C_B` for all
  `m`.  This is the quantifier order Copy-4's Step 3 consumes.

/-! ### The smooth comparison, applied to a rescaled smooth psh weight -/

/-- A smooth psh function bounded below on `A`, multiplied by `m ≥ 0`, satisfies the three
hypotheses `exists_overlapConst_finite` places on its weight `ϕ`: it is `C^∞` on `A`, its
Levi form is nonnegative on `A`, and it is bounded below on `A`. -/

/-! ### The overlap estimate for a singular weight -/

/-- **The fixed-cover overlap comparison for an arbitrary plurisubharmonic weight.**
One constant `C > 0`, depending only on the dimension and the finite ball family, with

`bergmanSup (ball (c i) (β i)) (e^{-mΨ}) x ≤ C · bergmanSup (ball (c j) (β j)) (e^{-mΨ}) x`

for every plurisubharmonic `Ψ` on `Ω`, every `m > 0`, every pair `(i, j)` and every
`x` in both inner half-balls.  `Ψ` may take the value `-∞`.

This is `BergmanOverlapFixedCover.exists_overlapConst_finite` composed with the two-layer
singular-weight limit; `A` is boundedly exhausted by `Ω`, which is what lets the mollifier
layer run on `A`. -/
