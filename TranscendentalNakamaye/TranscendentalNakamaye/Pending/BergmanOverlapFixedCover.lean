# The overlap constant fixed by the cover alone, before the weight

Source: Copy-4, `lem:regularization`, Step 2 (`transcendental-nakamaye-copy4-20260911`);
blueprint `ana:regularization`.

`QuantitativeRegularizationBergmanOverlap.bergmanSup_le_of_pointExtension` proves
`eq:reg-overlap` for a *given* cut-off `θ` and a *given* weight `ϕ`, with a constant
`pointExtensionConst d r Mθ R S` that does not mention `ϕ`.  Copy-4 needs more than
that: it fixes the cover `U_j ⋐ V_j ⋐ B_j ⋐ B_j⁺` and the constant `C_B` **once and
for all**, and only afterwards chooses the background form `ζ` and the potential `φ`.
Frontier item 4 of `scratch/tn-classical-regularization-frontier-20260922-r2.md`
records that no module assembles that yet, and item 3 records that only one of the
two directions `j ≤ l`, `l ≤ j` was available.

This module supplies both, at the level of coordinate balls:

* `exists_cutoff_ball` — a smooth cut-off equal to `1` on `closedBall c ρ`, supported
  inside `ball c β`, with `|θ| ≤ 1` and a *finite* bound on `‖dθ‖`.  The gradient
  bound is what enters the overlap constant, and mathlib's `ContDiffBump` supplies
  the function; the bound itself is compactness of the support.
* `exists_overlapConst_ball` — for a pair of balls `ball c β`, `ball c' β'` with
  compact closure in `D`, ONE constant `C > 0`, depending only on `d` and the radii,
  such that the one-sided comparison holds for EVERY admissible weight `ϕ` and every
  `x ∈ ball c (ρ/2) ∩ ball c' β'`.  The order of quantifiers is the point: `C` is
  chosen before `ϕ`.
* `exists_overlapConst_ball_pair` — the two-sided statement with a single constant,
  which is `eq:reg-overlap` in the form Copy-4 uses.
* `exists_overlapConst_ball_pair_log` — the same in the logarithmic normalization,
  `|ψ_j - ψ_l| ≤ C_B` before dividing by `m`.

**Scope.**  As everywhere upstream, `ϕ` is a *smooth* psh weight bounded below on `D`;
the passage to `ϕ = m Ψ` with `Ψ` singular is blocker 1 of the frontier note (I-0227,
I-0228) and is untouched here.  Nothing in this module is a restatement: the weight is
universally quantified after the constant, which none of the existing statements does.

/-! ### The constant chosen before the weight -/

/-- **One overlap constant for every weight** (Copy-4, `lem:regularization`, Step 2).
For a pair of coordinate balls with compact closure inside `D`, a single `C > 0`,
depending only on the dimension and the radii, controls the Bergman sup-weight of
`ball c β` by that of `ball c' β'` at every point of `ball c (ρ/2) ∩ ball c' β'`,
simultaneously for **every** smooth psh weight `ϕ` bounded below on `D`.

The constant is quantified before the weight; this is the property Copy-4 needs when
it fixes the cover before choosing the background form `ζ`. -/

/-! ### A finite cover, one constant -/

/-- **The cover fixed before the weight** (Copy-4, `lem:regularization`, Step 2).
Given a *finite* family of coordinate balls `ball (c i) (β i)`, each with compact
closure in `D` and each carrying its inner radius `ρ i`, there is ONE constant
`C > 0`, depending only on the dimension and the family, such that for **every**
smooth psh weight `ϕ` bounded below on `D`, every pair of indices and every point in
the intersection of the two inner half-balls, the two Bergman sup-weights are
comparable with that constant.

This is Copy-4's `C_B`: chosen from the cover alone, before `ζ` and before `φ`.
Taking `i = j` is harmless, and the statement is symmetric in `i, j` by construction. -/
