# The exhaustion and the Dini step of the collar construction

Two ingredients of CT22 Lemma 4.3, Step 3 (node `695c24b3e585`, comment-3,
items 4 and 5) that are independent of the current-theoretic content.

## The exhaustion

The collar construction glues on an increasing family of compacta exhausting the
open set `U` where `ψ` is finite and chart-smooth, and each compactum comes with
two open collars around it.  What the construction actually consumes is weaker
than a `CompactExhaustion`: since the family is monotone with union `U`, every
point of `U` lies in `K m` for all large `m`, and `K m ⊆ N m` where the cut-off
vanishes.  So `K m ⊆ interior (K (m+1))` is never needed.

## The Dini step

To choose the index `k_m` of the regularization the construction needs
`sup_{closure V_m} (ψ_k - ψ) < s_m/4` for large `k`, which is Dini's theorem
(`Pending.ThetaCapacityDecreasingConvergence.exists_forall_lt_add_of_antitone_of_continuousOn`)
applied on the compact set `closure V_m`.  Dini needs the functions to be
*continuous real* functions there, and what the regularization supplies is
analytic singularities in the `I-0489` convention.  The bridge is below: a
function with analytic singularities smooth off its poles is continuous, as a
real function, at every point where it is finite.

`K m ⊆ interior (K (m+1))` of `CompactExhaustion` is not needed, because the
cut-off of `Pending.CompactCollarCutoff.exists_chartSmooth_collar` already
