# The Ohsawa--Takegoshi interface

`OhsawaTakegoshiHyperplane` is the one analytic input of the proof of strong openness for
increasing sequences (`Pending.HiepSliceAssembly`) that is not proved in this workspace.
This module only *states* it; it contains no `sorry`, so every module that takes the
interface as a hypothesis can be imported by the root build.  It is derived from its regular
case (`Pending.StrongOpennessFromRegularOhsawaTakegoshi`), which is proved
(`Pending.OhsawaTakegoshiRegularProof`, via Hörmander's `L²` estimate); the resulting
unconditional statements are in `Pending.StrongOpennessRegularRoute`.

## The L² input

`OhsawaTakegoshiHyperplane` is the Ohsawa--Takegoshi extension theorem
(T. Ohsawa and K. Takegoshi, *On the extension of L² holomorphic functions*,
Math. Z. 195 (1987) 197--204) for the hyperplane `{z_m = 0}` of a convex
domain of `ℂ^{m+1}` that is bounded in the last coordinate.  Convexity is used
only through pseudoconvexity, and is taken as the hypothesis here because
pseudoconvexity is not defined in this workspace while convexity is.  This
pins the route down: it is the one of Hiep (C. R. Acad. Sci. 2014), where the
L² extension is only ever applied on polydiscs and balls, and never Guan--Zhou's
own iteration over the sublevel sets of a plurisubharmonic exhaustion, which
are pseudoconvex but essentially never convex.  Following that variant instead
would first require a pseudoconvexity predicate here.

The exponent `c > 0` is carried explicitly rather than normalized to `1`: the
general case is the special case applied to `c • φ`, which is again
plurisubharmonic, so stating it directly is no stronger and spares the consumer
a plurisubharmonic-scaling lemma this workspace does not have.  The conclusion
asserts no `AEMeasurable`, so a `WeightedL2On` consumer must supply that
separately.

The constant depends only on the bound `R` for the last coordinate (`1620·R²`
classically, `π·R²` sharply), and is quantified existentially so that no
numeric normalization is asserted.  It is quantified *before* the domain, the
weight and the function, so it is uniform over all of them; that is the
classical statement and not a weakening.  The measurable-space instances are
the `borel _` ones, matching `IncreasingStrongOpenness`: mathlib's default
instance on `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin n)` is only propositionally equal to
`borel _`, so stating the interface without them would put its `volume` in a
different type from the consumer's.

The nearest statement in this workspace's reference library is Demailly, *Complex Analytic
and Differential Geometry*, VIII-7.1 and VIII-7.5 (`demailly-cadg`), which is
the weaker 1982 extension theorem: it does not give the Ohsawa--Takegoshi
constant and cannot replace this interface.

/-- The Ohsawa--Takegoshi L² extension theorem from the hyperplane
`{z_m = 0}` of a convex domain `Ω ⊆ ℂ^{m+1}` whose last coordinate is bounded
by `R`: every holomorphic function on the slice which is `L²` for the weight
`e^{-φ}` extends to a holomorphic function on `Ω` which is `L²` for the same
weight, with a constant depending only on `R`.  The exponent `c > 0` is carried
because `c • φ` is again plurisubharmonic, so the general case is the special
case applied to a rescaled weight; stating it directly spares the consumer a
plurisubharmonic-scaling lemma, and the constant is still independent of `c`.

This is an interface, not a theorem of this workspace. -/
