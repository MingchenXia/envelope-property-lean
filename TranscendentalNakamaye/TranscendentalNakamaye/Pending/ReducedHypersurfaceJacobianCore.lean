# Reduced hypersurface input for the Jacobian derivative core

For a holomorphic hypersurface generator, the algebraic statement that its
principal germ ideal is reduced is expected to imply that some first derivative
is nonzero on a dense relative-open part of every nonempty local branch.
`HolomorphicGermRing` now supplies a holomorphic local ring, and
`HolomorphicGermReducednessBridge` proves the conditional local implication
from a radical principal germ ideal together with a unit-times-coordinate-power
factorization to a nonzero coordinate derivative.

Accordingly this file names that differential consequence explicitly as
`HasGenericallyNonzeroHypersurfaceDerivative`.  It is not presented as a
definition of algebraic reducedness.  From it we prove the exact usable result:
the derivative core contains no nonempty relatively open hypersurface patch,
and is therefore a proper local core when the branch is nonempty.

The remaining gap is analytic-to-algebraic: the project still has no theorem
that converts the article's reduced local hypersurface presentation into both
the radicality of its concrete principal germ ideal and the required local
unit-times-coordinate-power factorization at the relevant points.  Thus the
generic derivative predicate below remains the exact global input until that
translation is formalized.
