# The Noether property of analytic subsets of a compact complex manifold

Source: Grauert--Remmert, *Coherent analytic sheaves*, Ch. 5, §6 and Ch. 9, §1
(every decreasing sequence of analytic sets is stationary on compact subsets);
Boucksom, *Divisorial Zariski decompositions*, proof of Theorem 3.17 ("by the
strong Noetherian property of analytic sets"); blueprint `ana:locus-properties`.

On a compact complex manifold the closed analytic subsets satisfy the descending
chain condition; equivalently every nonempty family of analytic subsets has a
minimal member.

PROVED in `Pending.AnalyticDescendingChain`: germs of a descending chain stabilize at
each point (Noetherianity of the ring of holomorphic germs), the stabilization spreads to a
fixed neighbourhood by the identity theorem along the connected regular parts of the local
decomposition, and compactness makes the chain stationary.
`Pending.LocusProperties.exists_kahlerCurrent_poleSet_eq_nonKahlerLocus` uses it.
