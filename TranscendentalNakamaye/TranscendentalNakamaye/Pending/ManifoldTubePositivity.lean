# Step 6 of `prop:principalization` on the manifold

Source: Copy-4, step 6 of the proof of `prop:principalization`:

> For `B ≫ 1`, there is a relatively compact neighborhood `U` of `W` on a
> neighborhood of whose closure
> `Ω_U := θ_Y - Θ_D - ½δ₀ π^*ω + ddᶜ(f̃ + B r_W²) > 0`:
> indeed, along `W` the restriction of `Ω_U` to `T_W` is `A_W`, while the Levi
> form of `r_W²` is positive semidefinite with kernel exactly `T_W`.

`Pending.GlobalTubeFunction` builds `r_W²` and its Levi properties;
`Pending.UniformTubePositivity` and `Pending.PlaneTubePositivity` carry the
pointwise and uniform linear algebra.  This file does the manifold bookkeeping:

* `ddcClosedForm`: `ddᶜψ` of a chart-smooth function as a genuine
  `ClosedRealOneOneForm`, so that `β + B • ddᶜψ` is a form and chart-independence
  of strict positivity (`Pending.KahlerPerturbation`) applies to it.  The type
  `(1,1)` field is `FirstPass.MongeAmpere.smoothDDC_isOneOne`, the closedness
  field is `d² = 0`.
* `exists_pos_forall_strictPosAt_add_smul_ddc`: the sentence above, with `r_W²`
  abstracted to any chart-smooth `ρ` whose Levi form along the compact `W` is
  semipositive and on whose null directions `β` is positive.  ONE constant `B`
  and ONE open `U ⊇ W`, which is the manuscript's quantifier order.
* `exists_tube_forall_strictPosAt`: the two combined — for a compact submanifold
  `W` and a form `β` positive on the tangent directions of `W`, the tube function
  and the constant exist together.

The constant cannot be taken monotonically large uniformly on a neighbourhood:
the patched tube is only semipositive *along* `W` (the partition-of-unity cross
terms change sign off `W`), so the finite subcover argument has to close at the
points of `W` and use openness of strict positivity afterwards.  That is the
shape of `Pending.UniformTubePositivity.
exists_isStrictlyPositive_add_smul_of_pos_on_null_atCompact`, reproduced here on
the manifold because `StrictPosAt` is not a statement about a fixed chart.

/-- **Step 6's positivity sentence, on the manifold.**  If the Levi form of the
chart-smooth `ρ` is semipositive at every point of the compact `W`, and `β` is

open `U ⊇ W` make `β + B ddᶜρ` strictly positive on all of `U`.

Only the preferred chart at each point of `W` appears in the hypotheses;
`Pending.KahlerPerturbation.StrictPosAt.isStrictlyPositive` turns the conclusion
into strict positivity in every chart. -/

/-! ### The tube and the constant, together -/

/-- **Step 6 of `prop:principalization`.**  On a compact complex manifold, let `W`
be a closed set all of whose points are regular of dimension `k`, and let `β` be a
closed real `(1,1)`-form which is strictly positive along the tangent directions
of `W` — i.e. on the kernel of the differential of every NONDEGENERATE holomorphic
flattening of `W` in every ambient chart.  Then there are a chart-smooth `r ≥ 0`
vanishing on `W`, a constant `B > 0` and an open `U ⊇ W` with `β + B ddᶜr` strictly
positive on `U`.

The injectivity clause in `hβ` is not decoration (I-0356): without it, replacing
the last `n - k` coordinates of a flattening by their squares produces another
admissible `F` whose differential vanishes on the normal directions, and `hβ`
would collapse to strict positivity of `β` in ALL directions along `W` — which
Copy-4 does not have, and which would make the tube redundant.

Discharging a hypothesis quantified over ALL nondegenerate flattenings still needs
the independence of `(dF)⁻¹(ℂᵏ × 0)` from `F`, which is not in the tree.  A
consumer that does not want to prove it should use the two-step route instead:
`Pending.GlobalTubeFunction.exists_chartSmooth_tube` hands back one concrete
flattening per point, and `exists_pos_forall_strictPosAt_add_smul_ddc` above
consumes the Levi form of the tube directly, with no flattening in its
statement. -/
