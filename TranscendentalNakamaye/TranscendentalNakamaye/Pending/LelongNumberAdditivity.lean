# Arithmetic of Lelong numbers

Source: Demailly, *Complex analytic and differential geometry*, III.5 (the Lelong number as a
normalised mass, and Demailly's comparison theorem), III.7.

The development defines `lelongNumber u x` as the supremum of the `γ ≥ 0` admitting a bound
`u ≤ γ log ‖· - x‖ + C` on a punctured neighbourhood of `x`.  For a quasi-psh `u` this agrees
with the mass-theoretic Lelong number (Demailly III.5), and in that description the following
are immediate; in the sup-of-log-bounds description they are not, because an admissible
exponent for a sum need not split.  Only the two facts consumed by the non-nef locus argument
are recorded.

* `lelongNumber_add_le`: subadditivity.  (Equality holds; only `≤` is used.)  PROVED, from
  `Pending.LelongNumberSubadditivity`.  The sup-of-log-bounds description does not see it
  directly — the sphere-supremum functional is not additive — so the proof goes through the
  ball mean, whose slope is identified with the supremum's by a Harnack sandwich.
* `lelongNumber_ne_top`: PROVED, from `Pending.LelongNumberFiniteness`, which reduces it to
  Hadamard's three-circle inequality.  In positive dimension, a quasi-psh function that is not
  identically `-∞` has finite Lelong numbers.  BOTH extra hypotheses are essential.
  `ManifoldQuasiPlurisubharmonic` is the raw criterion and admits the identically `⊥` germ
  (`FirstPass.QuasiPshSingularities`), for which every exponent is admissible and the Lelong
  number is `⊤`; and in dimension `0` the punctured-neighbourhood filter is `⊥`, so every
  exponent is admissible for every function (compare
  `Pending.BlowupNonKahlerLocus.lelongNumber_pos_of_dim_eq_zero`).
