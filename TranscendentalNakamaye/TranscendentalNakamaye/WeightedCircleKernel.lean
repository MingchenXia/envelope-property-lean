# Weighted integration of a nonnegative circle-kernel inequality

This is a measure-theoretic statement about arbitrary measurable nonnegative
extended functions. Its pointwise angular hypothesis can be supplied by a
local geometric argument; no plurisubharmonicity, real representative, local
integrability, or finiteness of either integral is assumed here.

/-- Tonelli's theorem integrates a pointwise angular bound against an arbitrary
measurable nonnegative weight. The bound is needed only where the weight is
nonzero, and the coefficient and weight may both take the value infinity. -/
