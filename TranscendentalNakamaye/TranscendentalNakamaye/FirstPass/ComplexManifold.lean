# Complex manifolds and real differential forms in charts

The manifold structure is mathlib's holomorphic chart compatibility, together
with the usual Hausdorff and second-countability conditions. A real differential
form is represented by smooth continuous alternating forms in these charts,
with the ordinary real derivative in the change-of-coordinates equation.

Coefficient functions are extended arbitrarily outside their chart targets;
only their restrictions to those open targets have geometric meaning. No global
exterior-derivative operator or coordinate-independence theorem is assumed here.
