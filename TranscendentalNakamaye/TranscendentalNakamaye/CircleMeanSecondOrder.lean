# Recovering the Laplacian from the circle submean inequality

For a C² function, the circle submean inequality at all sufficiently small
positive radii forces its actual Laplacian to be nonnegative at the center.
The proof uses a quadratic perturbation and the forward submean theorem:
subtracting `k * ‖z - c‖²` changes the Laplacian by `4 * k`, and changes the
circle mean by `k * R²`.
